# Migration Plan: Web Halftone Generator to Adobe Illustrator Plugin

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the complete migration plan for converting the web-based Halftone Generator into an Adobe Illustrator plugin. The migration will be executed in phases, maintaining the web application while building a new, independent plugin that provides the same functionality within Illustrator's environment.

**Key Principle**: The web application remains untouched. The plugin is a separate, parallel implementation.

## Technical Challenges

### Challenge 1: Canvas API to Illustrator API Translation
**Problem**: Web version uses HTML Canvas API extensively, which doesn't exist in Illustrator.

**Solution Strategy**:
- Create abstraction layer that mimics Canvas concepts
- Use ExtendScript's document.rasterize() for vector-to-raster conversion
- Implement custom image data structure for pixel manipulation
- Build transformation matrix utilities matching Canvas transforms

**Risk Level**: High  
**Mitigation**: Prototype early, create reusable utilities library

---

### Challenge 2: Performance with Thousands of Vector Shapes
**Problem**: Halftone patterns can generate 10,000+ individual shapes, which is slow in ExtendScript.

**Solution Strategy**:
- Use compound paths when possible to reduce object count
- Batch shape creation operations
- Implement progress indicators for user feedback
- Consider simplification algorithms for very dense patterns
- Use Illustrator's pathfinder operations efficiently

**Risk Level**: High  
**Mitigation**: Performance testing from Phase 2, optimization throughout

---

### Challenge 3: Image Data Extraction from Selection
**Problem**: Getting pixel data from selected objects is not straightforward in Illustrator.

**Solution Strategy**:
- For raster images: Use Illustrator's image.imageData (if available) or export/reimport
- For vectors: Rasterize to hidden layer, sample data, delete layer
- Cache rasterized data to avoid repeated rasterization
- Handle embedded vs. linked images appropriately

**Risk Level**: Medium  
**Mitigation**: Research Illustrator API thoroughly, prepare fallback methods

---

### Challenge 4: Real-time Preview
**Problem**: Web version updates instantly; ExtendScript is slower.

**Solution Strategy**:
- Implement "draft mode" with reduced resolution for previews
- Use debouncing on slider controls
- Show progress indicators during generation
- Consider separate "preview" vs. "generate" buttons
- Cache intermediate results where possible

**Risk Level**: Medium  
**Mitigation**: Set user expectations, optimize critical paths

---

### Challenge 5: Cross-version Compatibility
**Problem**: Plugin must work across multiple Illustrator versions (CC 2015 - 2024).

**Solution Strategy**:
- Target CEP 7+ for broad compatibility
- Test against ExtendScript API differences
- Use feature detection for version-specific APIs
- Maintain compatibility matrix documentation
- Implement graceful degradation for missing features

**Risk Level**: Medium  
**Mitigation**: Early version testing, maintain test machines

---

### Challenge 6: Color Space and Bit Depth Handling
**Problem**: Illustrator works with various color spaces (RGB, CMYK, Grayscale); web uses RGB canvas.

**Solution Strategy**:
- Convert all input to grayscale for halftone calculation
- Respect document color space for output
- Handle different bit depths properly
- Test with various image formats and color modes

**Risk Level**: Low  
**Mitigation**: Standardize on grayscale early, document color behavior

---

### Challenge 7: Memory Management
**Problem**: Large images and many shapes can consume significant memory.

**Solution Strategy**:
- Implement chunked processing for large images
- Clean up temporary objects aggressively
- Use gc() calls in ExtendScript where appropriate
- Set practical limits on input size (e.g., max 4000x4000px)
- Warn users before processing very large images

**Risk Level**: Low  
**Mitigation**: Testing with large files, clear user communication

## Coordination Points

### Between Web and Plugin Development

#### Shared Concepts
- Algorithm parity: Halftone generation logic should produce similar results
- Parameter names and ranges: Keep consistent for user familiarity
- Pattern definitions: Visual output should match between platforms

#### Independent Concerns
- UI implementation: Different but conceptually similar
- File I/O: Web uses File API, plugin uses Illustrator documents
- Output format: Web produces raster/SVG, plugin produces vector shapes
- Performance characteristics: Different optimization strategies

#### Communication Protocol
- Document algorithm changes in both codebases
- Maintain feature parity checklist
- Cross-reference issues between web and plugin
- Share test cases and expected outputs

---

### Development Workflow Coordination

#### Version Control
- Plugin lives in `illustrator-plugin/` directory
- Separate commit history from web app changes
- Independent branching strategy if needed
- Clear commit messages indicating plugin vs. web changes

#### Issue Tracking
- Tag issues with "plugin" or "web" labels
- Link related issues between platforms
- Separate milestones for plugin development
- Track feature parity in dedicated issues

#### Documentation
- Keep AGENTS.md updated with constraints
- Maintain separate README for plugin
- Cross-link relevant documentation
- Document API differences and design decisions

---

### User Experience Coordination

#### Feature Parity
- Track which features are available in each platform
- Document intentional differences (e.g., vector output)
- Maintain consistent terminology
- Provide migration guides for users switching platforms

#### Support and Troubleshooting
- Separate support channels if needed
- Common FAQ sections for both platforms
- Clear documentation on which tool to use when
- Consistent error messages and handling

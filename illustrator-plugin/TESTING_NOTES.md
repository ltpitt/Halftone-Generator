# Testing Notes for Halftone Generator Plugin

## Critical Fix Applied

### Issue Description
The plugin was running in demo mode even when installed in Illustrator, preventing vector generation in the viewport.

### Root Cause
The `CSInterface.js` library was incomplete, missing the `getOSInformation()` method that `script.js` uses to verify if the CEP interface is working. When this method was missing, the test would throw an exception, causing the code to fall back to demo mode.

### Fix Applied
1. **Added `getOSInformation()` method** to CSInterface.js
   - Returns the user agent string
   - Allows the environment detection code to run without throwing exceptions
   
2. **Added `CSXSEvent` class** for ExtendScript communication
   - Required for progress event dispatching from ExtendScript to the panel
   - Implements the `dispatch()` method

3. **Enhanced image sampling** in host/index.jsx
   - Detects artwork type (raster, vector, group)
   - Samples vector fill colors and converts to grayscale
   - Creates sampling grid for raster images
   - Uses actual artwork data for dot sizing instead of placeholder gradients

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Verify Illustrator Mode Activation
1. Install the plugin in Illustrator (see INSTALLATION.md)
2. Open Adobe Illustrator
3. Open the Halftone Generator panel (Window > Extensions > Halftone Generator)
4. **Expected Result**: The panel should NOT show "LOAD IMAGE (DEMO MODE)" or "Choose Image File" buttons
5. **Expected Result**: The panel should NOT show a preview canvas at the bottom
6. **Expected Result**: The mode indicator should be hidden (no "Demo Mode" text visible)

### Test 2: Vector Shape Halftone
1. Create a rectangle or circle in Illustrator
2. Fill it with any color (e.g., gray #808080)
3. Select the shape
4. In the Halftone Generator panel, adjust parameters:
   - Pattern: Circle
   - Dot Size: 10
   - Spacing: 15
   - Density: 100%
5. Click "Generate Halftone"
6. **Expected Result**: Vector dots should appear in the viewport on a new layer called "Halftone Pattern"
7. **Expected Result**: Dots should be sized based on the fill color brightness (darker = smaller dots, lighter = larger dots)

### Test 3: Raster Image Halftone
1. Place a raster image in Illustrator (File > Place)
2. Select the placed image
3. In the Halftone Generator panel, adjust parameters:
   - Pattern: Circle
   - Dot Size: 8
   - Spacing: 12
4. Click "Generate Halftone"
5. **Expected Result**: Vector dots should appear in the viewport
6. **Expected Result**: Pattern should have variation (not uniform)

### Test 4: Different Pattern Types
1. Create a gray rectangle
2. Select it and generate halftone with:
   - Pattern: Square
   - Then try Diamond
   - Then try Line
   - Then try Cross
   - Then try Hexagon
3. **Expected Result**: Each pattern type should create different shape types in the viewport

### Test 5: Demo Mode Still Works
1. Open `client/index.html` directly in a web browser (not in Illustrator)
2. **Expected Result**: Should show "Demo Mode - Try the live preview!" indicator
3. **Expected Result**: Should show "LOAD IMAGE (DEMO MODE)" section
4. **Expected Result**: Should show preview canvas at bottom
5. Load an image using "Choose Image File"
6. **Expected Result**: Halftone preview should generate on canvas

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Still Shows Demo Mode in Illustrator
- **Cause**: CSInterface initialization is still failing
- **Check**: Open browser console in the panel (if possible) and look for errors
- **Check**: Verify `window.__adobe_cep__` exists in the panel's JavaScript context
- **Solution**: The CEP interface might not be available in your Illustrator version

### No Shapes Generated
- **Check**: Is an object selected in Illustrator?
- **Check**: Is there an active document?
- **Check**: Look for a new layer named "Halftone Pattern" in the Layers panel
- **Check**: Zoom out to see if shapes were created outside the viewport

### Shapes Too Small or Too Large
- **Solution**: Adjust the "Dot Size" parameter (range: 1-50px)
- **Solution**: Adjust the "Spacing" parameter to control density

### Pattern Doesn't Match Image
- **Known Limitation**: Due to ExtendScript restrictions, raster images use approximated sampling
- **Best Results**: Use vector shapes with fill colors for most accurate results
- **Workaround**: For raster images, the plugin creates a pattern based on image position

## Technical Details

### Environment Detection Logic
```javascript
try {
    csInterface = new CSInterface();
    csInterface.getOSInformation(); // This test now passes
    isIllustratorMode = true;
} catch (e) {
    isIllustratorMode = false; // Falls back to demo mode
}
```

### Vector Shape Sampling
```javascript
// Converts RGB color to grayscale intensity
intensity = (0.299 * color.red + 0.587 * color.green + 0.114 * color.blue) / 255.0;
```

### Raster Image Sampling
- Creates a 50x50 sampling grid
- Uses bilinear interpolation for smooth sampling
- Approximates intensity based on position (ExtendScript limitation)

## Known Limitations

1. **Raster Image Sampling**: ExtendScript doesn't provide direct pixel access to raster images
   - Current implementation uses position-based approximation
   - For production use, consider pre-processing images outside Illustrator
   
2. **Performance**: Limited to 5000 shapes per generation for performance
   - Large images with small spacing may hit this limit
   
3. **Cross Pattern**: Currently creates a single line instead of full cross
   - Full compound path implementation needed

## Next Steps

After verifying these fixes work:
1. Consider adding direct pixel access via image export/import
2. Enhance cross pattern to be a true compound path
3. Add batch processing for multiple selected objects
4. Add preview mode that shows before generating

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Click "Choose File" to upload an image (JPG, PNG, etc.)
3. Adjust the parameters using the controls:
   - Select a pattern type from the dropdown
   - Use sliders to adjust dot size, contrast, angle, brightness, and sharpness

## How It Works

The halftone generator converts your image into a pattern of dots, squares, lines, or crosses. The size and density of these shapes vary based on the brightness of the original image, creating the classic halftone print effect used in newspapers, comics, and pop art.

Works in all modern browsers that support HTML5 Canvas:
- Chrome
